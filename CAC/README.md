# UV-vis_cac.py
 Takes results from Bruker UV-vis critical aggregation concentration (CAC) experiment and outputs them to both a stacked spectra and the CAC graph. Just run this in a terminal and follow the prompts. Contains options for single wavelength (Nile red) and multi-wavelength (Pyrene, DPH) experiments. 
 
 In the Bruker software, after running all of your experiments, go to File > Export Data, which will allow you to output an Excel sheet with a column for each experiment. For Horiba instrumentation, you can run File > Export > Text/ASCII, and export a .csv file.
