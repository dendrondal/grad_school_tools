# TEM

This module enables automated generation of size distribution from folders of TEM images. Utility renames all TEM files (.tiff) in folder based on metadata present within the image. Useful for sorting images by material. Has only been tested for images output by a JEOL 1230 instrument, may require tweaking for others.
